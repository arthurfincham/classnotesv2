## :bulb: Overview
One of my hobbies is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, a martial art which depends on the accumilation of knowledge and skill. A problem, however, is how to keep track of all this knowledge. Enter Classnotes: a simple, lightweight journal to accompany learning. The idea is that after class you can write down what you learned, tag it, and then build a repository of techniques and ideas that can be quickly accessed.
